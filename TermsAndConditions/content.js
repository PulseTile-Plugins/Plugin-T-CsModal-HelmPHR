            All parts of this agreement apply to the maximum extent
            permitted by law. A court may hold that we cannot enforce part of this agreement as
            written. If this happens, then we may exercise our right under condition 12 above and
            replace that part with terms that most closely match the intent of the part that we
            cannot enforce. This is the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of
            Helm services. It supersedes any prior agreement or statements regarding your use of
            Helm services. If you have confidentiality obligations related to Helm services, those
            obligations remain in force (for example, you may have been a beta tester). The
            headings used in this service agreement do not affect the interpretation of its terms
            and conditions.<br />
